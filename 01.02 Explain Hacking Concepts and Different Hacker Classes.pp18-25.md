Hacking involves exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to resources. It often means modifying a system or application to function in a way not intended by its creator. This can be used to steal or redistribute intellectual property, leading to business losses. Network hacking is typically performed using scripts or network programming  and includes techniques like creating viruses and worms, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, creating botnets, phishing, and password cracking. Motivations for hacking vary widely, from financial gain, prestige, and vengeance to intellectual challenge, curiosity, and peer recognition.

## Who is a Hacker? ðŸ¤”

A **hacker** is an intelligent individual with excellent computer skills who can create and explore computer software and hardware. They are typically skilled programmers or engineers with enough knowledge to find vulnerabilities in a target system. Hackers often enjoy learning the details of different programming languages and computer systems.

While some hack as a hobby to see how many systems they can compromise , others have malicious intent, such as stealing business data, credit card information, social security numbers, and email passwords. Their intentions can range from simply gaining knowledge to performing illegal activities.

## Hacker Classes and Motivations

Hackers are categorized based on their activities and motivations.

* **Script Kiddies**: Unskilled hackers who use scripts and tools developed by others. They focus on the quantity of attacks over quality  and generally lack a specific goal beyond gaining popularity.
* **White Hat Hackers (Penetration Testers)**: These individuals use their hacking skills for defensive purposes with permission from the system owner. Organizations hire them as security analysts to secure networks against malicious attacks.
* **Black Hat Hackers (Crackers)**: Individuals who use their advanced computing skills for illegal or malicious purposes and are often involved in criminal activities.
* **Gray Hat Hackers**: These hackers work both offensively and defensively at different times. They might find vulnerabilities and report them to vendors to help improve product security.
* **Hacktivists**: Individuals who break into government or corporate systems as a form of protest to promote a social or political agenda. They often deface websites or leak confidential information to raise awareness. Despite their intentions, their actions constitute a crime.
* **State-Sponsored Hackers**: Professionals employed by a government to penetrate and gather top-secret information from other nations. Their goal is to exploit a target nation's infrastructure and gather intelligence.
* **Cyber Terrorists**: Individuals motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear through large-scale disruption of computer networks.
* **Corporate Spies (Industrial Spies)**: Professionals hired to illegally spy on competitor organizations to steal critical information like trade secrets, blueprints, and marketing plans. They often use advanced persistent threats (APTs) to remain undetected for long periods.
* **Blue Hat Hackers**: Contract-based security professionals hired by organizations to test systems and software for vulnerabilities before their release.
* **Red Hat Hackers**: Vigilantes who adopt aggressive, black-hat-like tactics to neutralize threats and destroy black-hat activities, often going beyond mere defense. They are proactive but do not adhere to the same ethical rules as white hats.
* **Green Hat Hackers**: Newcomers motivated by a desire to become skilled cybersecurity professionals. They focus on studying and practicing ethical hacking to contribute positively to security efforts.
* **Suicide Hackers**: Individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a "cause" without concern for punishments like jail time.
* **Insiders**: A trusted employee with access to critical assets who uses that privileged access to intentionally cause harm or steal information from the organization. Insider threats often come from disgruntled or terminated employees.
* **Criminal Syndicates**: Organized groups involved in planned, long-term criminal activities online. Their primary goal is to embezzle money through sophisticated cyber-attacks and money laundering.
