# Objective 06 Explain the Importance of Applicable Security Laws and Standards

### Information Security Laws and Standards 
**Laws** are a system of rules and guidelines that are enforced by a particular country or community to govern behavior. A **Standard** is a “document established by consensus and approved by a recognized body that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context”. This section deals with the various laws and standards dealing with information security in different countries.

## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and POS cards. This standard offers robust and comprehensive standards and supporting materials to enhance payment card data security. These materials include a framework of specifications, tools, measurements, and support resources to help organizations ensure the safe handling of cardholder information.

PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing, including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers, as well as all other entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS comprises a minimum set of requirements for protecting cardholder data. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council has developed and maintains a high-level overview of PCI DSS requirements.

#### PCI Data Security Standard - High-Level Overview 
* **Build and Maintain a Secure Network** 
    * Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
    * Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
* **Protect Cardholder Data** 
    * Protect stored cardholder data.
    * Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
* **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program** 
    * Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs.
    * Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
* **Implement Strong Access Control Measures** 
    * Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know.
    * Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
    * Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
* **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks** 
    * Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
    * Regularly test security systems and processes.
* **Maintain an Information Security Policy** 
    * Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.

Failure to meet PCI DSS requirements may result in fines or the termination of payment-card processing privileges.
