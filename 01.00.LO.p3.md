### Detailed Objectives

Attackers break into systems for various reasons and purposes. Therefore, it is important to understand how malicious hackers attack and exploit systems and the probable reasons behind these attacks. As Sun Tzu states in the Art of War, “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat”. System administrators and security professionals must guard their infrastructure against exploits by knowing the enemy—malicious hackers who seek to use the same infrastructure for illegal activities.
