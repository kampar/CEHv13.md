## Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks

Learning the hacking methodologies and frameworks helps ethical hackers understand the phases involved in hacking attempts along with the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by real hackers. This knowledge further helps them in strengthening the security infrastructure of their organization. This section discusses various hacking methodologies and frameworks such as the CEH ethical hacking framework, cyber kill chain methodology, MITRE ATT&CK framework, and Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.

### CEH Ethical Hacking Framework

EC-Councilâ€™s CEH ethical hacking framework defines the step-by-step process to perform ethical hacking. The CEH ethical hacking framework follows the same process as that of an attacker, and the only differences are in its hacking goals and strategies. This methodology helps security professionals and ethical hackers understand the various phases followed by real hackers in order to achieve their objectives. An understanding of the CEH ethical hacking framework helps ethical hackers learn various tactics, techniques, and tools used by attackers at various phases of hacking, which further guides them to succeed in the ethical hacking process.

According to the CEH ethical hacking framework, the following are the various phases involved in hacking:

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Footprinting and reconnaissance constitute the preparatory phase, in which an attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target prior to launching an attack. In this phase, the attacker creates a profile of the target organization and obtains information such as its IP address range, namespace, and employees.

Reconnaissance techniques are broadly categorized into **active** and **passive**.
* In **passive reconnaissance**, the attacker does not interact with the target directly and relies on publicly available information.
* **Active reconnaissance** involves direct interactions with the target system by using tools to detect open ports, accessible hosts, and other details.

**Scanning**
Scanning is used to identify active hosts, open ports, and unnecessary services on hosts. In this phase, the attacker uses details gathered during reconnaissance to scan the network for specific information. Scanning is a logical extension of active reconnaissance but involves more in-depth probing.

**Enumeration**
Enumeration involves making active connections to a target system to gather information such as network user lists, routing tables, and security flaws.

#### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability assessment is the examination of a system or application's ability to withstand assault. It recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and communication channels. Attackers perform vulnerability analysis to identify security loopholes in the target organization's network, communication infrastructure, and end systems.

---

#### Phase 3: Gaining Access

This is the phase where actual hacking occurs. Attackers use information gathered previously, along with techniques like password cracking, to gain access to the target system. Gaining access is the point where an attacker obtains access to the OS or applications on a computer or network. Once an attacker gains access, they attempt to escalate privileges to obtain complete control.

**Escalating Privileges**
After gaining access with a low-privilege account, an attacker may attempt to increase their privileges to the administrator level. The attacker exploits known system vulnerabilities to escalate user privileges.

---

#### Phase 4: Maintaining Access

Maintaining access is the phase where an attacker tries to retain ownership of the system. Once an attacker gains admin- or root-level privileges, they can use the system and its resources at will. The attacker can use the compromised system to launch further attacks or maintain a low profile and continue exploitation. They can maintain control by closing vulnerabilities to prevent other hackers from exploiting them.

---

#### Phase 5: Clearing Tracks

To remain undetected, it is important for attackers to erase all evidence of a security compromise. They might modify or delete system logs using log-wiping utilities to remove all evidence of their presence.

### Cyber Kill Chain Methodology

The cyber kill chain methodology is a component of intelligence-driven defense for identifying and preventing malicious intrusion activities. This methodology helps security professionals identify the steps adversaries follow to accomplish their goals. It aims to enhance intrusion detection and response by outlining seven phases of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to the final objective.

The seven phases are:
1.  **Reconnaissance**: The adversary gathers data on the target to find weak points.
2.  **Weaponization**: The adversary creates a malicious payload (e.g., malware, virus) using an exploit and a backdoor.
3.  **Delivery**: The payload is sent to the victim via email, USB, or other means.
4.  **Exploitation**: The malicious code is triggered, exploiting a vulnerability on the victim's system.
5.  **Installation**: Malware is installed on the target system to maintain access.
6.  **Command and Control (C2)**: A channel is created for two-way communication between the victim's system and the adversary's server.
7.  **Actions on Objectives**: The adversary performs actions to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration or disruption of services.

***

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Organizations should understand TTPs to protect their network against threat actors and upcoming attacks. TTPs enable organizations to stop attacks at an initial stage.

* **Tactics**: Describe how a threat actor operates during an attack, including methods for information gathering, privilege escalation, and maintaining persistence.
* **Techniques**: The specific methods used during an attack's execution, such as initial exploitation, setting up C2 channels, and covering tracks.
* **Procedures**: A sequence of actions performed by threat actors to execute steps of the attack life cycle.

***

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

IoCs are clues, artifacts, and forensic data on a network or OS that indicate a potential intrusion. They serve as data points in the threat intelligence process.

**Categories of IoCs:**
* **Email Indicators**: Sender's email address, subject, attachments, or links.
* **Network Indicators**: URLs, domain names, and IP addresses.
* **Host-Based Indicators**: Filenames, file hashes, registry keys, and DLLs.
* **Behavioral Indicators**: Specific malicious activities, like a document executing a PowerShell script.

**Key IoCs Include:**
* Unusual outbound network traffic.
* Anomalous activity from privileged user accounts.
* Geographical anomalies.
* Multiple login failures.
* Suspicious registry or system file changes.
* Unusual DNS requests.

***

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It is used to develop threat models and methodologies. ATT&CK for Enterprise contains 14 tactic categories derived from the later stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.

**Enterprise Tactics Include:**
* Initial Access 
* Execution 
* Persistence 
* Privilege Escalation 
* Defense Evasion 
* Credential Access 
* Discovery 
* Lateral Movement 
* Collection 
* Command and Control 
* Exfiltration 
* Impact

### Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The Diamond Model is a framework for analyzing intrusions by identifying clusters of correlated events. It defines any intrusion activity as a "Diamond event" consisting of four core features.

* **Adversary**: The opponent or hacker behind the attack.
* **Capability**: The strategies and tools used by the adversary.
* **Infrastructure**: The hardware or software used by the adversary to reach the victim.
* **Victim**: The target that has been exploited.

The model also includes **meta-features** like Timestamp, Phase, Result, and Direction to connect related events.

## Information Security Controls

Information security controls are used to prevent unwanted events and reduce risk to an organization's information assets. The core concepts are **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**, as well as **authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation** for user access.

***

### Information Assurance (IA)

IA refers to the assurance that the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of information and systems are protected during usage, processing, storage, and transmission. Processes that help achieve IA include developing security policies, identifying vulnerabilities, designing authentication strategies, and providing IA training .

***

### Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy

This strategy involves continuous prediction, prevention, detection, and response actions for comprehensive network defense.
* **Prediction**: Identifying potential attacks and targets before they occur through risk assessments and threat intelligence.
* **Protection**: Implementing countermeasures like security policies, firewalls, and host security to eliminate vulnerabilities.
* **Detection**: Monitoring the network for abnormalities, unauthorized access, and attacks.
* **Responding**: Taking action to identify incidents, find root causes, and mitigate their impact.

***

### Defense-in-Depth

This is a security strategy where several protection layers are placed throughout an information system. It is based on the military principle that a multi-layered defense is harder to defeat than a single barrier. If one layer is breached, the next layer still provides protection, giving administrators time to respond.

***

### Risk Management

Risk is the degree of uncertainty that an adverse event may cause damage. Risk management is the process of reducing and maintaining risk at an acceptable level through a security program.

**Risk Management Phases:**
1.  **Risk Identification**: Identifying the sources, causes, and consequences of internal and external risks.
2.  **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks to prioritize them.
3.  **Risk Treatment**: Selecting and implementing appropriate controls to modify the risks.
4.  **Risk Tracking and Review**: Ensuring controls are implemented and evaluating the performance of risk management strategies.

***

### Incident Handling and Response (IH&R)

IH&R is the process of taking organized steps when reacting to a security incident or cyberattack.

**Steps in the IH&R process include:**
1.  **Preparation**: Auditing resources, training the response team, and defining policies.
2.  **Incident Recording and Assignment**: Reporting and recording the initial incident details.
3.  **Incident Triage**: Analyzing, validating, categorizing, and prioritizing the incident.
4.  **Notification**: Informing stakeholders about the incident.
5.  **Containment**: Preventing the incident from spreading to other assets.
6.  **Evidence Gathering and Forensic Analysis**: Collecting evidence for investigation.
7.  **Eradication**: Removing the root cause of the incident.
8.  **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems and services to normal operation.
9.  **Post-Incident Activities**: Documenting the incident, assessing the impact, reviewing policies, and closing the investigation.

### Role of AI and ML in Cybersecurity

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are widely used to defend against cyber threats that traditional methods might miss. AI/ML helps identify new exploits and weaknesses, allowing for proactive mitigation.

**How AI and ML Prevent Attacks:**
* **Password Protection and Authentication**: AI improves biometric validation and facial recognition to prevent credential breaches.
* **Phishing Detection**: AI and ML can scan and identify phishing emails and malicious websites much faster than humans.
* **Threat Detection**: ML algorithms analyze data to detect threats and notify admins before systems are compromised.
* **Vulnerability Management**: AI-based systems dynamically scan for vulnerabilities and can forecast when an exploitation might occur.
* **Behavioral Analytics**: AI generates user behavior patterns and alerts admins to any suspicious deviations, helping to detect compromised accounts.
* **Network Security**: AI can analyze network traffic and propose efficient security policies automatically.
