## Information Security Concepts
Information security is the protection or safeguarding of information and information systems that use, store, and transmit data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Information is a critical organizational asset. If sensitive information is compromised, the organization may suffer significant financial, reputational, or customer losses. This section provides an overview of information security, including its core elements, attack classifications, and the concept of information warfare.

### Elements of Information Security
Information security is a state where the possibility of theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services is kept low or tolerable. It is founded on five main elements: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

* **Confidentiality**: This is the assurance that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Breaches can occur from improper data handling or hacking attempts. Controls for confidentiality include data classification, data encryption, and the proper disposal of equipment like DVDs and USB drives.
* **Integrity**: This refers to the trustworthiness of data or resources, preventing improper or unauthorized changes. Measures to maintain integrity include using checksums and implementing access controls to ensure only authorized individuals can modify data.
* **Availability**: This is the assurance that systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users. Measures to maintain availability include using redundant systems like disk arrays, employing antivirus software, and implementing DDoS prevention systems.
* **Authenticity**: This characteristic ensures that a communication, document, or any data is genuine and uncorrupted. Its primary role is to confirm a user is genuine. Controls like biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates are used to ensure authenticity.
* **Non-Repudiation**: This guarantees that the sender of a message cannot later deny sending it, and the recipient cannot deny receiving it. Digital signatures are commonly used to ensure non-repudiation.

### Information Security Attacks: Motives, Goals, and Objectives
An attack is an action intended to breach an IT system's security by exploiting its vulnerabilities. This involves attempts to obtain, edit, destroy, or reveal information without authorization. An attack can be represented by the formula: `Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method (TTP) + Vulnerability`.

A motive arises from the perception that a target system holds something of value, leading to a threat. Attackers use various tools and techniques to exploit system vulnerabilities to achieve their motives.

Motives behind information security attacks include:
* Disrupting business continuity 
* Stealing information and manipulating data 
* Creating fear and chaos by disrupting critical infrastructures 
* Causing financial loss to the target 
* Propagating religious or political beliefs 
* Achieving a state's military objectives 
* Damaging the target's reputation 
* Taking revenge 
* Demanding ransom 

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
TTPs refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups. Understanding TTPs is crucial for analyzing threats, profiling threat actors, and strengthening an organization's security infrastructure.

* **Tactics**: The strategy an attacker follows from the beginning to the end of an attack. Understanding tactics helps in predicting and detecting evolving threats early.
* **Techniques**: The technical methods an attacker uses to achieve intermediate results during an attack. Understanding techniques helps in identifying vulnerabilities and implementing defensive measures.
* **Procedures**: The systematic approach a threat actor follows to launch an attack. Analyzing procedures helps identify what an attacker is targeting within the organization's infrastructure.

### Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness in a system's design or implementation that can be exploited to compromise its security. It often acts as a loophole allowing an attacker to bypass authentication. The two main causes of vulnerabilities are software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices.

Common reasons for vulnerabilities include:
* **Hardware or software misconfiguration**: Insecure configuration of network hardware or software can create security loopholes. For instance, using an unencrypted protocol can lead to network intrusions.
* **Insecure or poor design**: An improperly designed network may be susceptible to threats and data loss.
* **Inherent technology weaknesses**: Some hardware or software may not be capable of defending against certain attacks. Systems running old browser versions, for example, are prone to attacks.
* **End-user carelessness**: Human behavior is susceptible to attacks like social engineering, which can lead to data loss. Sharing login credentials is a common example.
* **Intentional end-user acts**: Ex-employees with continued access to company resources can misuse them, causing significant data and financial loss.

#### Examples of Vulnerabilities

**Table 1.1: Technological Vulnerabilities** 
| Vulnerability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| TCP/IP protocol vulnerabilities  | Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, ICMP, SNMP, and SMTP are inherently insecure. |
| Operating System vulnerabilities  | An OS can be vulnerable because it is inherently insecure or not patched with the latest updates. |
| Network Device Vulnerabilities  | Devices like routers and firewalls can be vulnerable due to a lack of password protection, no authentication, insecure routing protocols, or firewall vulnerabilities. |

**Table 1.2: Configuration Vulnerabilities** 
| Vulnerability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| User account vulnerabilities  | Arise from the insecure transmission of usernames and passwords over the network. |
| System account vulnerabilities  | Result from setting weak passwords for system accounts. |
| Internet service misconfiguration  | Enabling JavaScript or misconfiguring services like IIS and FTP can create security vulnerabilities. |
| Default password and settings  | Leaving network devices with their default passwords and settings creates an opening for attackers. |
| Network device misconfiguration  | Improperly configuring a network device. |

### Classification of Attacks
Security attacks are classified into five categories: passive, active, close-in, insider, and distribution.

* **Passive Attacks**: These attacks involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic without tampering with the data. They are difficult to detect because there is no active interaction with the target system. Examples include sniffing and eavesdropping.
* **Active Attacks**: These attacks tamper with data in transit or disrupt services to break into secured systems. They involve sending traffic actively to the target, which can be detected. Examples include Denial-of-Service (DoS), Man-in-the-Middle, session hijacking, and SQL injection.
* **Close-in Attacks**: These are performed when the attacker is in close physical proximity to the target system. The goal is to gather, modify, or disrupt access to information. Examples include social engineering methods like eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving.
* **Insider Attacks**: These are performed by trusted individuals with privileged access to critical assets. Insiders can bypass security rules to access sensitive information, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Examples include theft of physical devices and planting keyloggers or malware.
* **Distribution Attacks**: These occur when attackers tamper with hardware or software before it is installed. They may modify the hardware or software at its source or during transit. An example is a backdoor created by a vendor during manufacturing.

### Information Warfare
Information warfare, or InfoWar, refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to gain a competitive advantage over an opponent. It can be divided into defensive and offensive strategies.

* **Defensive Information Warfare**: Involves all strategies and actions designed to defend against attacks on ICT assets. This includes prevention, deterrence, alerts, detection, emergency preparedness, and response.
* **Offensive Information Warfare**: Involves attacks against an opponent's ICT assets. This includes web application attacks, web server attacks, malware attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and system hacking.

Martin Libicki categorized information warfare into several types:
* **Command and control warfare (C2 warfare)**: Refers to an attacker's control over a compromised system or network.
* **Intelligence-based warfare**: Uses sensor-based technology to directly corrupt technological systems to dominate the battlespace.
* **Electronic warfare**: Uses radio-electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication.
* **Psychological warfare**: Uses techniques like propaganda and terror to demoralize an adversary.
* **Hacker warfare**: Can involve shutting down systems, data theft, system monitoring, or spreading false messages using tools like viruses and Trojan horses.
* **Economic warfare**: Affects a business or nation's economy by blocking the flow of information.
* **Cyberwarfare**: The broadest category, defined as using information systems against the virtual personas of individuals or groups.
